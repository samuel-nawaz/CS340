About the Project/Project Title
This project has us importing the Austin Animal Center’s database of sheltered animals and having us incorporate Create and Read functionality to it via Python inside a Mongo system.

Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to simplify the process of querying the database in Mongo and making easier to update. By utilizing Python scripts inside the Mongo system, we are able to utilize the CRUD operation.

Getting Started
The first thing we did was import the Austin Animal Center’s Outcome dataset and indexed it.

 

Next, we created admin and user accounts with WRITE privileges and different passwords. To verify that this process was successful, we had to close out of Mongo and log back in using the correct credentials.
 
 
  

Installation
The tools we used to install this were Jupyter notebook, MongoDB, and PyMongo libraries and ObjectID’s.

Usage
Use this space to show useful examples of how your project works and how it can be used. Be sure to include examples of your code, tests, and screenshots.

Code Example
 

 
 

Tests
I have been unsuccessful in getting the codes to work correctly. Ideally, I would import the python function and run the script to pull documents.

Module 5 Explanation
For module 5, we expanded our previous work to include the Update and Delete portions of the CRUD method. We utilized the PyMongo driver within the MongoDB as it offers connectivity, update, write, and delete. We then tested to ensure that each part of the CRUD methodology, Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
Module 7 Explanation
Module 7 was the culmination of everything we have done in this class. This was by far the most challenging 2 weeks of the course. We again used MongoDB as it offers connectivity, update, write, and delete functions which are crucial to this project. The dash framework includes widgets and radio buttons to make the entire project more user friendly, as well as the Grazioso Salvare logo to maintain branding and prevent confusion among users. 
In this part, we first reviewed the Dashboard Specifications Document to ensure that we stayed within the allotted parameters. After determining the parameters, we coded based off of the given starter code, this was the most difficult and time consuming part of the project. After coding, we then tested the code, making corrections as they arose. As we did this, we also had to ensure that the table was interactive and user friendly.
The biggest obstacles I had to overcome were from my personal life as my entire household had to deal with a stomach bug. Outside of this, I really struggled with debugging as every other line of code seemed to have an issue. It was also very difficult getting the table to become interactive and pull from the database. Overall, this was a very challenging assignment, however, it was very rewarding as I learned a lot about coding, debugging, and patience.
•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
In order to write maintainable code it must be legible to a person reading it, testable to find and correct issues/bugs/defects, and it must be readable and executable by the system. Anyone of these tasks can cause code to not be maintainable. Understanding the purpose of the code and consistently updating/patching it allows it to adaptable. In terms of connecting the widgets from project one to the database in project, I utilize the coordination skills I used to ensure that I correctly do each part that is required when creating and updating. 
•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
As a computer scientist, I tend to work backwards, meaning I outline the desired outcome first then break that into chunks, then break each chunk into smaller parts, then I begin working to solve the issue. If I were building something, even a tool to correct an issue, I would do it this way as it helps ensure that I correct everything that the client is asking. The assignments for this course were much harder than any I have received before, academically, this is my first time working with databases, and my first time ever not using SQL. The best technique I learned really was to organize and outline the work BEFORE STARTING. It always made the work run much smoother if I just followed my outline.
•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists find innovative ways to solve issues that others don’t even know exist. Prior to the internet, we didn’t know we needed multiple forms of instant communication. Computer scientists also make work run more efficiently as algorithms and automation allow for the work of thousands to be done in hours. Without computer scientists we wouldn’t have any of the luxuries that we have today, i.e. online college, a means to work from home, instant communications, etc. My work on this project would help companies find their data much faster than manually retrieving it, also, it allows it to be updated instantaneously. It definitely increases speed and accuracy while also decreasing errors.
